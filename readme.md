# 3D Dice Websocket Server
This is a PHP websocket that uses Ratchet for connection.
It allows the multiplayer portion of the 3D Dice roller to function.

It was not designed for scale or security and I will provide minimal support for operating your own.

A composer.json file is included to import the necessary required libraries.
